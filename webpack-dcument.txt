1)install webpack
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server typescript ts-loader

2)Go to the package.json amd change the version
in script tag

start": "webpack-dev-server",
    "build":"webpack"

 "devDependencies": {
    "ts-loader": "^6.2.1",
    "typescript": "^4.3.4",
    "webpack": "^4.41.2",
    "webpack-cli": "^3.3.10",
    "webpack-dev-server": "^3.11.2"
  }
  
 3) tsconfig.json
 "module": "coomonjs", updated with "module": "es2015", target: es6
 Also Comment root Dir
 
4) For compile: npm run build (if not workiing then go to the package.json "devDependencies" and remove the ts-loader "^" and 
run npm install then run "npm run build")

Algorith For Webpack:
1. Define the webpack configration file
2. write entry and outout files locations
3. define the rules for compiling the code
4. make use of resolve statement to tell compiler that which conversion they needs to do before
5. define new rules inside the package.json

publicPath is used for the see the output directly in console

/********webpack.config.js******/

//node programming
const path = require('path');
module.exports ={
    entry: "./src/index.ts",
    output: {
        filename: "bundle.js",
        path: path.resolve(__dirname,'dist'),
       publicPath:'dist'
    },
    devtool: 'inline-source-map',
    module: {
        rules:[
            {
                test: /\.ts$/,
                use:'ts-loader',
                exclude: /node_modules/
            }
        ]
    },
   resolve:{
       extensions:['.ts','.js']
   }
};
